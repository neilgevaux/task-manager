# README

This is based on a time management webinar I attended. Some people there didn't seem to have an online system where they could prioritise tasks and were using pen and paper, or a spreadsheet, which is fine! But I wanted to see if I could build something that helped.

It's in progress still, but based on the philosphy of spiltting tasks into:

* Urgent and important
* Urgent and not important
* Not urgent and important
* Not urgent and not important

I thought It would be good to call these containers "taskbuckets", where the user can assign tasks based on these categories (and/or custom categories too). Each bucket displays the number of tasks inside.

* Ruby version 2.7.4

* Rails version 7.0.1

* Postgres version 14.1

# To do

This is still in progress, it's not styled yet beyong basic Bootstrap. It also needs better testing.

In future, I plan on automating the urgency of tasks based on date.
